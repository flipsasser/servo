Servo
=

Servo serves your static filesystem via the web. Fun for testing simple static websites or generally being a weirdo.

It's easy:

1. `gem install servo`
2. `servo ~/Path/to/directory` or just `servo` for current directory
3. Open [http://localhost:9292/](http://localhost:9292/)
4. Profit

Usage
==

Basics: `servo [options] [directory]`

Directory is optional and defaults to the current working directory.

Options are:

- `-p PORT, --port PORT` will serve on `PORT` supplied. So `servo -p 3001` will serve the current directory at `http://localhost:3001`

Oh look, it's just one option. Yeah, it's a simple little app.
